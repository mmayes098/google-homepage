Welcome to my Google Homepage project from The Odin Project!
This project is for me to build, from scratch, a page that looks (but not functions) like Google's homepage.
3/1: So far I have added the logo and a search input box into the webpage, and styled them so that they appear in the
	center horizontally and a little bit down the page as well. I used CSS to center the items using left/right
	margins and absolute positioning to center in the viewport.
